## Description

In addition to the basic functionalities of a banking application, we have implemented 2 ideas for our users who are interested in protecting the environment:

- Round Up | for each transaction, the payment amount is rounded to the next higher dollar (eg 2.43 -> 3) and the difference is deposited in a savings account. The user can opt for the transfer of a percentage of this money to an eco account from which they can easily donate to a cause they supports.
- QR Scan Subway | we encourage our users to use public transport in this way: qr codes are found in subway stations that travelers can scan once a day. With each scan, the user is sent to the login page where their location is checked, and they receive an eco point. At 10 eco points, a tree is added to their online orchard, and at 50 points, the bank plants a tree.
