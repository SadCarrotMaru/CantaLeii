        <img src = "sponsori/million_trees.jpg" width="300em" height="300em" style="border-radius: 50%;" >
        <p> This East Moline, Illinois, program is an offshoot of a river-cleanup nonprofit that has pulled almost 10.4 million pounds of trash from local waterways since 1998. Founder Chad Pregracke has expanded the group's mission to grow native oaks from volunteer-collected acorns, tend them in a nursery, and then transfer them to riverbanks and watersheds. The organization met its first million-tree milestone in 2016, and is shooting for a second one.</p>
